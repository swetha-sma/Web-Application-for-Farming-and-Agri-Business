# Web-Application-for-Farming-and-Agri-Business

Farming is a profession with hard labor and effort. Moreover seeing the growing population of our country we should take initiatives to help farmers of our country. Our project work is designed to find out appraisal of problems and prospect of peasant farming in our country. During the study, data was collected through the use of questionnaire and survey. In this survey taken we came to know the importance of communication needs to be viewed as a core value in farming business. Effective communication is something that should be expected, routine and rewarded. The study therefore focused on developing a website to help farmers ensure greater profitability through direct communication. So we decided to bring a solution named ‘AG Beyond’. The website serves as a business card, a salesperson, a shop and a plant-savvy best friend. As agricultural producers strive to improve production methods and productivity, they shouldn’t forget that communication with others can help get the job done. The farmers can get to know the availability of crops varieties around their district which will help other farmers to cultivate new crop varieties in their area. These ideas automatically pave a way to support the local economy. Nowadays most of the people are disconnected from the natural world hence this initiative makes the user more aware of the agricultural benefits.
